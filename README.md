🥩 Halal Wagyu Supply Chain dApp

This project is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) that ensures halal authenticity, traceability, and transparency for imported Wagyu beef using Ethereum smart contracts.

📌 Project Overview

The system records every stage of the Wagyu supply chain — from producer, halal authority, distributor, to retailer — on the blockchain.
Once data is stored, it cannot be altered, ensuring trust for consumers and authorities.
